# Machine Learning - 2022/2023
Machine Learning project developement repo.

Project Developed by: Marina Prieto Pech.

# ABOUT THE REPO:

## 1. Unsupervised Learning

We have the following information about it:

- **UnsupervisedDataset** -> WorldCup dataset for the development is inside the folder.
- **Unsupervised_MarinaPrieto** -> Google CoLab file with the development of the task.

## 2. Supervised Learning

For this section, we have documentation in pdf format available in the **Documents** folder.

- **SupervisedDatasets** -> Train and test values for the algorithm, information about the Nepal Earthquake.
- **Supervised_MarinaPrieto** -> Google CoLab file with the development of the task.
- **SupervisedSubmission** -> Submissions for the results of the training execution, formated as .csv files.

## 3. Natural Language Processing

Same as before, we have documentation in pdf format available in the **Documents** folder.

- **NLPDatasets** -> Since the plataform didn't allow me to upload the file, it will be needed to import the **products.csv** file as an external source into the CoLab environment. 
- **NLP_MarinaPrieto** -> Google CoLab file with the development of the task.
